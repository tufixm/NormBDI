The jibx tutorial modified for Jadex XML.
It shows how the same binding information 
is specified from jibx is specified in Jadex XML.
Note, that not all examples are working. 

   01   * A basic binding
   02   * Attributes, optional access, and more
   03   * Unordered elements
(x)04   * Structure mapping - flattened binding
(x)05   * Structure mapping - split binding
   06   * Structure mapping - ignored components
   07   * Basic collection handling
   08   * Heterogeneous collection, with factory
(x)09   * Collections with mappings
   10   * Working with IDs
   11   * Normal multiple mapping
   12   * Normal multiple mapping
   13   * Simple abstract mapping
   14   * Named abstract mappings
() 15   * Abstract and extension mappings
   16   * Extending a concrete mapping
   17   * Namespaces
() 18   * User extension method hooks
() 19   * Custom value serialization
   20   * Custom marshallers and unmarshallers
      Note that the test for this example may not operate properly on all JVMs because the order in which values are retrieved from a hashmap iterator is not consistent across JVMs. This is only a problem with the test, though, which looks for an exact round-tripping of the input document (including the order of child elements). If the test fails with an error message like "Different attributes - from line ... to line ..." it means that this issue occurs with the JVM you're using.
   21   * Controlling JiBX with front-end code
